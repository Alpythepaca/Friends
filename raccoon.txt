Out and about in the open forests of what was the UK there was a sweet and smart raccoon with what looked like an old burger king crown on top of his head!
He was escorted by what he called his royal army of faithful and protective raccoon army,while out on a expedition they stumbled into a panda chugging from a barrel of rum and a cute fluffy alpaca.
The alpaca and panda both looked towards the army and thought what are the king and army doing out here at this time?
the raccoon walked past his army and started sniffing around in which he told the panda he is really stinky and should take a shower,Then looked at the alpaca with a blush and then called the alpaca a cutie.
We asked what are you doing out here king? 
He then states that he is looking for more people to join his army and kingdom to help the raccoon population to grow since it was dwindling in numbers.
The alpaca and panda both stated well we arent raccoons but we'd be happy to join and help you out!
After that time the 3 became the best of friends.
