Such a silly wonderful panda he is drinking gallons of rum a day! 
He eventually fell off his stool at the tavern and fell onto a fluffy alpaca. 
The kind fluffy alpaca helped the drunk panda up asking if he was alright. 
When the panda got his bearings he asked if had hurt the alpaca,
the alpaca then said wouldnt been the first time at the tavern a drunk panda has fallen on him then noticed that the panda seemed really friendly so asked.
Would you care for a drink and to have a chat you seem like the type of person i'd love to hang out with!
This is how the alpaca and panda began their friendship
