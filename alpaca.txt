He was tossed out of his family because they said he wasnt floofy enough.
So he traveled across the world searching for a new family and friends that would accept him for who he was,
great lengths he traveled finding so many amazing friends that he calls him family now!
He has an amazing panda that is like his older brother, a Sweet lil dergy that is his younger brother, a raccoon that makes him the loveliest and happiest alpaca!~
They've gone through it all fighting goblins, dark souls and bloodbourne like creatures that his older brother tried to have some fun with instead of fighting *facepalm*.
The raccoon taught me so much of the raccoon secrets like ssneaking in places with 3 of them stacked or telling panda funny things to make him angry!
My littliest brother loves to pester and sass my panda brother as well he bites his ankles,his ears, and his lil nub tail always such a funny sight to see,
maybe being tossed out of the family was the best thing to happen to this alpaca.
